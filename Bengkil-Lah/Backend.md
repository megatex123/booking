## Key Implementation Details

### datetime serialization
Socket.IO's JSON encoder doesn't handle Python `datetime`. All serializer functions (`serialize_booking`, `serialize_message`) call `.isoformat()` on every datetime field. There is also a recursive `_clean()` helper in `bookings.py` for nested structures.

### Geospatial
Workshops store a `location: { type: "Point", coordinates: [lng, lat] }` GeoJSON field. The `nearby` endpoint uses MongoDB `$near` with `$maxDistance` in metres. Haversine distance is also computed in Python for display.

### Inventory deduction + reorder alerts
When a booking is marked `completed` with `service_reports`, each `ProductUsed` record triggers:
```python
db.workshops.update_one(
    {"_id": workshop_id, "products._id": product_id},
    {"$inc": {"products.$.quantity": -quantity}}
)
```
After deduction, any product whose `quantity <= reorder_threshold` (and `reorder_threshold > 0`) triggers a `low_stock` push notification to the workshop owner. `reorder_threshold` is a new optional field on `ProductCreate` / `ProductUpdate` (default `0` = disabled).

### FastAPI route order rule
**Static routes must be defined before wildcard routes.** In `bookings.py` the route order is:
```
POST  /bookings/
GET   /bookings/my
GET   /bookings/vehicle-health   ← must come before /{booking_id}
GET   /bookings/{booking_id}
```
If a static path like `/vehicle-health` is registered *after* `/{booking_id}`, FastAPI matches it as a booking ID lookup and returns 404. This is a standard FastAPI gotcha.

### Car Health Score (`GET /bookings/vehicle-health`)
Groups completed bookings by vehicle plate, picks the most recent per plate, and computes:
```python
score = max(0, min(100, round(100 - elapsed_days / total_days * 100)))
# where total_days = next_service_months * 30
```
Falls back to vehicles listed in `current_user["vehicles"]` for unserviced vehicles (score = 100).

### Password hashing (Python 3.13 workaround)
`passlib[bcrypt]` is broken on Python 3.13. `security.py` calls `bcrypt.hashpw()` / `bcrypt.checkpw()` directly.

### Smart service reminders (scheduler)
`core/scheduler.py` exports an `AsyncIOScheduler` instance. On startup `main.py` adds a daily 09:00 UTC cron job that calls `check_service_reminders()`. That function:
1. Queries all completed bookings with `next_service_months > 0` and `reminder_sent != True`.
2. Computes `due_date = completed_at + next_service_months` (falls back to `updated_at` for old data).
3. If `due_date` is within ±7 days of today, calls `push_notification()` with type `service_reminder`.
4. Sets `reminder_sent: True` on the booking so it fires only once.

Bookings gain a `completed_at` timestamp when marked completed (added in `PATCH /bookings/{id}/status`).
